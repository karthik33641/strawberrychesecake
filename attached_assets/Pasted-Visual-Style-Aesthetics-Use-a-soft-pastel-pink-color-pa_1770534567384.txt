Visual Style & Aesthetics

Use a soft pastel pink color palette (#f8d7e3, #fce4ec, etc.) with cream textures and subtle doodle/heart patterns to create a romantic, comforting vibe. Pastel pink backgrounds tend to appear calm and welcoming, which suits the Valentine theme.

Apply a retro 8-bit pixel art style for characters (girlfriend with racket, boyfriend) and game graphics. Use a pixelated arcade font such as Press Start 2P for headings and score text, reinforcing the nostalgic arcade feel.

Incorporate heart motifs: floating pixel-hearts in the background and a heart-shaped mask or sprite that slowly rises/fades (implementable via CSS animations). Small animated hearts can float or burst on key events for extra romantic charm.

Use romantic typography for non-game text: e.g., Playfair Display for titles, a cursive font like Pacifico for affectionate script text, and a clean sans-serif like Poppins for body copy.

Layout and Sections

Opening Screen: Full-screen centered card. Background with floating hearts. Heading text “Before we start our story…”, subtext “Tell me your name, beautiful 💌”, and a rounded input field plus a “Start Our Story” button. After the user enters their name and clicks start, transition with a smooth fade to the main page and display the name dynamically in the next section.

Section 1 – Our Beginning 💕: Scrapbook/photo-card style layout. Include a placeholder photo frame with pink-tape graphics on the corners and a soft doodle background. Overlay romantic text using a CSS typewriter effect (letters appear one by one). Add tiny floating heart particles drifting upwards for ambience.

Section 2 – Pixel Badminton Game 🎮🏸: Arcade backdrop (subtle grid) with pixel-boyfriend on right and pixel-girlfriend (left, with a racket). Display the retro pixelated question: “HOW MANY TIMES DID HE MAKE YOU MAD?”. Below, place four large pixel-style buttons: 100, 1000, 10000, and INFINITE 😈. (Buttons should be rounded, high-contrast, in pixel font.)

Section 3 – Things I Love About You 💗: Six floating pastel cards, each containing a cute compliment. Each card should gently rotate or pop on hover. The background can be a soft doodle/heart pattern to match theme.

Section 4 – The Proposal 💌: Layered soft heart-pattern background with a subtle blur/glow. Center a framed image or graphic. Show a large script heading with “[Her Name]…” and below it the question “Will you be my Valentine?”. Provide two buttons: YES 💖 and NO 🙄.

Interactivity & Animations

Badminton Game Actions: When a number button is clicked, animate the girlfriend swinging her racket (using CSS @keyframes) and the shuttlecock flying across to strike the boyfriend. Trigger a funny impact animation (e.g., pixel sparks or stars).

100: One strong smash; boyfriend flies up/out once. Display text “He deserved that.”

1000: Three rapid smashes; boyfriend spins dizzyingly on hit. Show a cartoonish dizzy effect (like little stars circling his head).

10000: Five very fast smashes; include a noticeable screen-shake effect each hit. Then overlay an arcade-style “COMBO x5” text.

INFINITE: Continuous rapid smashes (~3 seconds), making the boyfriend respawn repeatedly with exaggerated effects. Flash big pixel-text “MERCY???” on screen. Finally display “He still loves you though.”

Use CSS transform (rotate/translate) and @keyframes for all movements (swinging racket, flying shuttlecock, flying/spinning boyfriend). For example, a typewriter effect can be achieved by animating an element’s width from 0 to full.

Include a “Madness Level: _” counter that increases with each hit, and a Reset button (“Okay okay I’m sorry 😭”) to stop animations and reset the scene.

Button Effects: The NO button should dodge on hover: use JavaScript to move it to a random position and shrink it slightly each time, so it’s never clickable. The YES button should gently pulse/glow on hover and enlarge slightly. On click, trigger the heart-explosion/confetti effect (with additional floating hearts) and the celebratory message.

Final Celebration: Clicking YES triggers a burst of hearts/sparkles across the screen, and the text “You just made me the happiest boyfriend alive.” Background romantic music swells softly.

Additional Features

Add smooth fade-in scroll animations and subtle sparkle effects near headings for extra charm.

Play a soft romantic instrumental background music, with a visible mute/unmute toggle.

Ensure the page is fully responsive (use flexible layouts, viewport meta, etc.) for mobile devices.

Implement everything in one HTML file (embedded CSS and JS, no external libraries). Use comments in the code to label sections (e.g., /* Section 2: Pixel Game */).

Every feature and animation should work as described to create a cohesive, cute, and playful Valentine’s Day mini-game experience.

Final Prompt Example
Design and implement a single-page Valentine’s Day web experience with a cute retro gaming theme. The page should have a pastel pink and soft red color palette, cream-textured backgrounds, and delicate heart/doodle patterns. Use Playfair Display for headings, a cursive font (like Pacifico) for script headings, and a clean sans-serif (like Poppins) for body text. Incorporate an 8-bit pixel art style for graphics and UI: use a pixel font (Press Start 2P) for arcade-style text:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.


- **Page 1 (Name Prompt):** Full-screen card with floating heart animations in the background. Heading: “Before we start our story…”, subtext: “Tell me your name, beautiful 💌”, a rounded text input for the name, and a “Start Our Story” button. Once the user submits a name, fade into the main content, and use the entered name in the next sections.


- **Section 1 – Our Beginning 💕:** Scrapbook-style section with a framed photo placeholder and pink tape corners. Display romantic intro text with a CSS typewriter effect (letters appear sequentially). Scatter tiny floating heart particles drifting upward.


- **Section 2 – Pixel Badminton Game 🎮🏸:** Retro arcade background with a subtle grid. Place a pixel-girlfriend character (left, with racket) and a pixel-boyfriend character (right, looking nervous). Show the question: “HOW MANY TIMES DID HE MAKE YOU MAD?” in pixel font. Provide four large pixel-art buttons labeled “100”, “1000”, “10000”, and “INFINITE 😈”.


  - *Interactions:* On clicking a button, animate the girlfriend swinging and the shuttlecock flying toward the boyfriend. Show a comedic hit reaction (boyfriend flying or spinning, with pixel spark effects):
    - **100:** Single strong smash (one hit, boyfriend knocked away), then display “He deserved that.”
    - **1000:** Three fast smashes; boyfriend spins with cartoon dizziness.
    - **10000:** Five very rapid smashes; include a screen-shake effect on each hit. Afterward, display “COMBO x5”.
    - **INFINITE:** Smash continuously for ~3 seconds, respawning the boyfriend each hit with flashy effects. Flash big “MERCY???” on screen, then end with “He still loves you though.”
  
  Include a “Madness Level: ___” counter that increments with each hit, and a reset button (“Okay okay I’m sorry 😭”) to stop and reset.


- **Section 3 – Things I Love About You 💗:** Gentle pastel-doodle background. Arrange 6 cute cards (like floating scrapbook cards), each with a sweet compliment. On hover, each card should rotate or scale slightly.


- **Section 4 – The Proposal 💌:** Layered soft heart-pattern background with blur/glow. Center a framed image or graphic. Heading: “[Her Name]…” in large script font. Text: “Will you be my Valentine?”. Two buttons: **YES 💖** (pink) and **NO 🙄** (gray).
  - *Behavior:* The NO button evades the cursor (moves randomly and shrinks on hover). The YES button glows and grows slightly on hover. Clicking YES triggers hearts/sparkles explosion, increases floating hearts, plays music, and shows “You just made me the happiest boyfriend alive.”


- **Animations & Effects:** Use CSS keyframes and transforms for all motion (swinging, flying, spinning). For example, animate an element’s width from 0 to full for the typewriter text effect. Create floating heart animations with CSS (opacity and translate). Apply subtle screen-shake on big hits, and sparkling confetti on celebrations.


- **Sound & Music:** Add a soft romantic background track with a visible mute toggle.


- **Responsiveness:** Ensure mobile-friendly layout (viewport meta, flexible sizing).


- **Implementation:** Put all code in one HTML file (inline CSS/JS). Include comments explaining each section and feature.
