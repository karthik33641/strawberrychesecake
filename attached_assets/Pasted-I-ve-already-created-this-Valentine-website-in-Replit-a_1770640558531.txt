I’ve already created this Valentine website in Replit and it’s mostly working great. I now need you to make only the following final 3 changes, very carefully — do not alter anything else or regenerate unnecessary parts.

🛠️ SECTION 1: INTRO
- Change the greeting line from:  
  “Tell me your name, beautiful 💌”  
  to:  
  **“Excuse me miss, may I know your name?”**

🖼️ SECTION 2: OUR BEGINNING
- Remove the current placeholder image inside the photo frame.
- Replace it with this new image I'm uploading now:  
  **[Upload “our beginning” image here]**
- Keep everything else in this section exactly as is.

🏸 SECTION 3: BADMINTON GAME — RAM EDITION
- Add a pixel-text label above the boyfriend character: **“RAM”**
- At the top of the section, change the game title text to:  
  **“How many times did RAM make you mad? Now beat the shi out of him 😤🏸”**
- Fix any **glitches, lag, or stutters** in the game.
- Smooth the animation transitions (swing, shuttle movement, impact).
- Add more dramatic, funny **pixel-smash animations** when RAM gets hit.
- Keep everything else as is.

💗 SECTION 4: THINGS I LOVE ABOUT YOU — FINAL TEXT UPDATES
Replace the following 3 compliment cards exactly:
1. Change: “The way you laugh at my terrible jokes”  
   ➜ **“How you have my back no matter what”**
2. Change: “How you always know exactly what I need”  
   ➜ **“How you always care about me”**
3. Change: “Your kindness to everyone you meet”  
   ➜ **“How you handle me, even when I’m being mean, dumb, or rage-baiting”**

Also:
- Improve the **floating hearts animation** in this section
- Make the cards animate with a **smoother entry and hover scale effect**
- Use a more **romantic or handwritten-style font** for these compliments

💘 FINAL PROPOSAL SECTION
- After clicking **YES**, add these floating effects:
  • Chocolate bars
  • Roses
  • Hearts
- Make them float gently across the screen
- Use my attached image as the final background centerpiece:
  **[Upload your final Valentine image here]**

DO NOT change anything else outside of these instructions.
DO NOT regenerate unrelated code or animations.

This is my **final update**. Please execute with precision.
